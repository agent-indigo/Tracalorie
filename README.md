# Tracalorie

This is a refactoring of the Tracalorie project from Brad Traversy's 2023 Modern JavaScript from the Beginning Second Edition course. I added a Bootswatch theme selector and also switched from using Local Storage to the JSON-Server NPM package.

## Note

This project requires the JSON-Server NPM package, which can be installed by running

### npm install

and started by running

### npm run server
